# 🌿 **Dr-Leaf: Plant Disease Detection System**

**Dr-Leaf** is an AI-powered web application designed to detect plant diseases from leaf images using deep learning. It aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in early disease identification for timely intervention and healthier crops.

---

## 🧠 **Project Overview**
- **Objective**: Diagnose plant diseases via image analysis.
- **Approach**: CNN model trained on diverse plant leaf images.
- **Outcome**: Web interface to upload leaf images and get predictions.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x
- Required packages in `requirements.txt`

### **Installation**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Manish9211Ram/Dr-Leaf.git
cd Dr-Leaf
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Model Setup**
- Download the `plant_disease_prediction_model.h5` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/Manish9211Ram/Dr-Leaf/releases) section.
- Place it inside: `app/trained_model/`

### **Run the App**
```bash
cd app
python app.py
```
Visit: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## 🧪 **Usage**
1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Upload a clear image of a plant leaf.
3. Click **Predict**.
4. Get the disease name and confidence score.

---

## 📊 **Model Training**
- Trained on the [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease).
- Training code and process available in `model_training_notebook/`.
